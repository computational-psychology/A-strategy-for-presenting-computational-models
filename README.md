# A strategy for presenting computational models

This repo contains our poster submission for [V-VSS 2021](https://2021.visionsciences.org) along with the Jupyter notebook that we reference in the poster.

Running the notebook requires an installation of Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook, as well as the following Python packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ipywidgets


### Acknowledgements
The notebook started out as a replication attempt of [1] by Lynn Schmittwilken, Nicolas Roth, Maher Shei, and Florian Blume, and was extended by Maximilian Pohlmann, 
with help from Lynn Schmittwilken, Marianne Maertens, and Guillermo Aguilar.
